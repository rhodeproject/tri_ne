    The Triathlon Club of New England (Tri-NE) was established in 2010 to serve the growing population of multi-sport athletes in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts and create a community of teamwork, support and training for beginner to intermediate triathletes.  One of the best aspects of triathlon is the feeling of mutual respect and solidarity amongst athletes, and we at Tri-NE want to be a group that shares in that great spirit.

    Our mission is to be a welcoming community for the new athlete, a training network for the competitor, and a motivator for all. We want to be a place our members can experience personal athletic growth, join in the success of their teammates and share in the information and collective wisdom of the group. Individuals looking to begin or expand their training in any of the three disciplines of the triathlon are welcome.
